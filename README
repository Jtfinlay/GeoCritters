Welcome to the GeoMonsters Project.

This project is a Pokemon-style game that uses a spatial server to query nearby geographic features to return creature encounters.

Languages used: Java (Android), Javascript (Nodejs / SocketIO), PostgreSQL (Mapping server), Python (Map processing)

Current geographic features mapped and queried: Watercourses, waterbodies, forests, parks, and cemeteries. Current geographic areas include the provinces of Alberta and Ontario.
Map data originates from Open Street Maps, and was downloaded from download.geofabrik.de . 
Meteorological data has not yet been implemented. Will likely be used from openweathermap.org .

The creatures being used are not our property but here simply for testing purposes. They must be completely removed before project is released for public use.
